# TASK 5: FACE DETECTION AND RECOGNITION (Conceptual Outline)

# This script outlines the components needed for a Face Detection and Recognition AI.
# A full implementation requires installing libraries like OpenCV and potentially
# deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow/PyTorch) for more advanced recognition.

# --- Required Libraries (Install these using pip) ---
# pip install opencv-python   # For basic image processing and Haar cascade detection
# pip install numpy           # Often used with OpenCV

import cv2
import numpy as np
import os # For checking file existence

# --- Prerequisites for Haar Cascade Face Detection ---
# You need to download the Haar Cascade XML file for face detection.
# A common location is:
# https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml
# Save this file in the same directory as your Python script, or provide its full path.
