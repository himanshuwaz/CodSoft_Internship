# TASK 3: IMAGE CAPTIONING AI (Conceptual Outline)

# This script outlines the components needed for an Image Captioning AI.
# A full implementation requires installing deep learning libraries (TensorFlow/PyTorch),
# downloading pre-trained models, and potentially a dataset for training/fine-tuning.

# --- Required Libraries (Install these using pip if you want to run this conceptually) ---
# pip install tensorflow  # or pip install torch torchvision
# pip install transformers # For pre-trained NLP models like VisionEncoderDecoderModel
# pip install Pillow      # For image processing
# pip install numpy       # For numerical operations

import tensorflow as tf # Or import torch as th
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
import requests # For downloading images from URLs (example)

# For a real implementation, you'd use a pre-trained model from Hugging Face Transformers
# Example: from transformers import VisionEncoderDecoderModel, AutoTokenizer, AutoFeatureExtractor

# --- Placeholder for Model Loading ---
# In a real scenario, you would load pre-trained models here.
# For example, a pre-trained image encoder (like ResNet or ViT)
# and a pre-trained text decoder (like GPT-2 or a custom LSTM/Transformer).
